# Sendify Code Challenge: DB Schenker Shipment Tracker 


## The Task

Build a tool that provides tracking information for a DB Schenker shipment.

### Requirements

1. **Input** a DB Schenker tracking reference number 
2. **Returns** structured shipment information including:
   - Sender information (name, address)
   - Receiver information (name, address)
   - Package details (weight, dimensions, piece count, etc.)
   - Complete tracking history for the shipment
   - **Bonus:** Individual tracking events per package

### Data Source

Use the public DB Schenker tracking website:

[https://www.dbschenker.com/app/tracking-public/](https://dbschenker.com/app/tracking-public/?language_region=en-US_US)


### Example Reference Numbers

Use these reference numbers for testing:

| Reference Number |
|------------------|
| 1806203236       |
| 1806290829       |
| 1806273700       |
| 1806272330       |
| 1806271886       |
| 1806270433       |
| 1806268072       |
| 1806267579       |
| 1806264568       |
| 1806258974       |
| 1806256390       |

## Technical Requirements

- You may use **any programming language**
- Your solution must include clear instructions on:
  - How to set up the environment
  - How to build/install dependencies 
  - How to run the tool

## What We're Looking For

- **Problem-solving ability** - How do you approach extracting data from a public web interface?
- **Code quality** - Clean, readable, and well-structured code
- **Documentation** - Clear setup and usage instructions
- **Error handling** - Graceful handling of invalid references, network issues, etc.

## Submission

1. Create a public GitHub repository with your solution
2. Ensure all setup instructions are included in the README
3. Send us the link to your repository (holger@sendify.se)

## What Happens Next

If your submission meets our criteria, we'll invite you for a technical interview. Be prepared to:

- **Walk us through your code** - Explain your design decisions and architecture
- **Discuss trade-offs** - Why did you choose your approach over alternatives?
- **Answer technical questions** - We may ask you to explain specific parts in detail
- **Talk about improvements** - What would you do differently with more time?

This is your code - own it and be ready to reason about every part of it.
